    <header class="preamble">Something has gone terribly wrong. You just wanted to start a new life in a new neighborhood, realizing the dream of having a home, a career, and a family. Instead, you find yourself in a nightmare that can only be escaped with BABIES. Life doesn't always make sense, but you're along for the ride.

        <p class="headline__greeting">Welcome to... </p>
        <h1>Apocababy</h1>
        <p class="headline__description">The terrifying mash-up of the 100 Baby Challenge, Every Lot Challenge, and Rags to Riches. Only for those who relish chaos and struggle.</p>

    <h2>RULES to suffer by</h2>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>YOUR SIM</h3>
        <p>Your sim can be of any sex or gender you prefer, but they must be able to become pregnant. They must be a young adult made in CAS (no relationships, no skill points). They can have whatever likes/dislikes you prefer.
        </p>    
        <p>The sim may only have "negative" personality traits. Pick three from the traits listed below, as available by your personal combination of expansions and packs:</p>
            <ul class="list list--sim">
                <li>high maintenance</li>
                <li>clumsy</li>
                <li>erratic</li>
                <li>evil</li>
                <li>freegan</li>
                <li>gloomy</li>
                <li>hot-headed</li>
                <li>jealous</li>
                <li>lactose intolerant</li>
                <li>mean</li>
                <li>squeamish</li>
                <li>vegetarian</li>
                <li>(extra challenge) unflirty</li>
                <li>(extra challenge) hates children</li>
            </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>YOUR LOT</h3>
        <p>You may choose any lot in the game except for those in the neighborhood of Finchwick in Henford-on-Bagley.</p>
        <p>You must assign all possible lot challenges to the lot. You must also assign as many slightly-negative lot traits as available, choosing from those available by your personal combination of expansions and packs:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>cat hangout</li>
                <li>dog hangout</li>
                <li>mean vibe</li>
                <li>vampire nexus</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You may not assign any lot traits other than those listed as challenges or in the list just above.</p>
        <p>If you have the Paranomal pack and you really hate yourself, you may set your lot type to "haunted house".</p>
        <p>If you have Laundry Day, you must place a hamper on the lot.</p>
        <p>After the lot is set up and the sim is moved in, set money to 0. Make sure aging is set to normal.</p>
        
        <p>Look around your lot. You are never leaving this terrible cursed place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>RESTRICTED ITEMS</h3>
        <p>There are a few items that work around restrictions imposed by the negative lot traits in such a way that they aren't in the spirit of the challenge. You may not use:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>a cooler</li>
                <li>present piles or the holiday tree (outside of Winter Fest, if you have Seasons)</li>
                <li>the "Attic Stack" decoration box</li>
                <li>the apartment trash chute</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>YOUR MONEY</h3>
        <p>You can use any money-making method you would like, with the exceptions of cheats or those only available through a mod.</p>
        <p>If your sim takes a job that they go off-lot for, they cannot do so if there is a baby or toddler in the home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>TRAVEL</h3>
        <p>Not allowed. Your sim can go to their job if they have one, if allowed via the rule above. Your sim can go to the hospital to give birth, unaccompanied. But you, you will never leave this place. No loading screens. No accompanying your sim to work if they have an active career. No popping over to the pub. You must experience every awful moment in this hellscape you have chosen. I hope you chose well.
        </p>    
    </div>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>ROOMMATES AND MARRIAGE</h3>
        <p>The only way to add sims to your household is by birth. No marrying, no roommates, no shacking up. You brought this on yourself.</p> 
    </div>
        <h2>GET ME OUT OF HERE</h2>
        <p>You can only cleanse and leave this place through one method: making babies. Do not question why...the reason is so complex you just couldn't handle it. </p>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>HOW TO MAKE A BABY</h3>
        <p>Well, when one sim who can carry babies meets another sim who can provide baby juice, they share a very special kiss and...come on, you know how this works! </p>
        <p>Your sim must find another sim, one who is able to partner with them to provide a child (traditionally this would be a female/male pairing, but we recognize all permutations including male/alien). For each pregnancy, they must find another partner. No double-dipping. Yes, I just said that.
        </p>   
    </div>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>WHAT TO DO WITH THE BABY</h3>
        <p>In exchange for feeding, burping, and diapering a new spawn, you may also remove ONE lot trait. Use a random number generator to pick one. No, you can't choose. That would make things easy, and we don't like that.</p>
        <p>You can remove one trait per baby. That means, if you have a pregnancy that results in multiple babies, you can remove multiple traits! Awesome! Except then you will be raising multiple babies in this nightmare existence. Please, please do earn the "fertile" trait and do this to yourself. It's funny.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>WHEN CAN I GET RID OF THIS THING?</h3>
        <p>No baby BBQs in this game, kiddo. Wait, is there a mod for that? I haven't been that evil since Sims 2 days.</p> 
        <p>Your sim must raise their spawn until they are able to be independent. That means 18 years, y'all. No special skill count unlocks here; you can only age a baby/toddler/child/teen when the game gives you a notification that it is almost their birthday, using a cake if older than baby, or naturally if you can't acquire a cake. You can reuse the cake. I'm not a monster. </p>
        <p>If you neglect your spawn so badly that they get taken by social services, you lose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ruleset">
        <h3>BUT WHAT ABOUT AGING? MY SIM IS GETTING OLD</h3>
        <p>Yeah, I wish we could all roll back the clocks. Guess what? Your sim can! Feel free to use any non-cheat, non-mod method to give your sim more days on this coil if needed. Because if your sim hits elder and you have even one negative lot trait still? You fail. You know what happens if you fail? 
            Pretty much nothing, you just don't win.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>WHEN IS THIS HELL OVER?</h2>
    <p>When you have removed all lot traits, you are done. You've won. WHEE!</p>
