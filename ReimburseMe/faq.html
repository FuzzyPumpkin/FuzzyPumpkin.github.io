	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h2>How much does this cost...really?</h2>
	<p>Nothing. You can choose to pay for a premium membership for $10 per login. Premium
	 membership removes ads. It doesn't affect what forms you have access to, how many user
	  profiles you can set up, or how many forms you can submit or receive. It doesn't unlock 
	  any features. It removes ads. Period. And it is charged only one time, not yearly or
	   monthly.</p>
	
	<h2>Ugh. Ads.</h2>
	<p>Yeah, I know. I hate ads, too. Unfortunately, things cost money. Servers and my development time, 
	for example. Ads pay me so you don't have to. I try to make sure that the ads on this site are 
	relevant, not flashy or distracting, and aren't clickbait (Outbrain/Taboola ads are the worst!). 
	If the ads really bother you too much, you can pay $10 per login ONCE and never see one again. Here, 
	anyway.</p>
	
	<h2>Do I have to register?</h2>
	<p>No...but if you want to set up or use a user profile, you'll need to be registered. 
	User profiles are where the customization my app allows come into play. If you just want
	 to use the default categories and settings on each form and manually fill in where the 
	 forms will submit, you can do so without registering.</p>
	
	<h2>Wait...I only see one form to enter expenses on.</h2>
	<p>Exactly! I've tried to make this site as simple as possible to use. That means that you don't have to
	 pick the type of expense form you want to use. That means that you can, technically, enter expenses for
	 your medical flex account at the same time as you do that dinner you had with clients. When you click on 
	"Review", your entries are split into the applicable forms depending on how the user profile was set up.</p>
	
	<h2>What is this user profile you keep talking about? Is that just my account name?</h2>
	<p>No. A user profile is a set of preferences you or someone else has customized and saved so that they can 
	be reused. Every account can set up their own user profile. In addition, someone can share a user profile with 
	you to use. A user profile:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Has a unique id that is automatically assigned and can be shared.</li>
		<li>Has a "nickname" that is set by the person who creates it.</li>
		<li>Can only be edited or deleted by its creator.</li>
		<li>Changes what categories are available, what they are called, and specifies which form they 
		submit to.</li>
		<li>Sets a default recipient email address, by submission form.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>HELP ME! I don't know how to fill out this form!</h2>
	<p>Help documents will be forthcoming.</p>
	
	<h2>Why did you make this app?</h2>
	<p>I have extensive experience as a peon in Accounting. Not a CPA, not a CFO, but an 
	assistant. That means that I have taken care of processing a lot of employee submissions 
	for reimbursement, as well as reimbursement requests from volunteers and contractors. I've 
	used printed forms only where everything is submitted by hand. I've used Sharepoint, and I've 
	investigated other services/apps/programs that have been created to streamline reimbursements. 
	None of them were perfect. All of the other apps out there were behind a paywall so high that it 
	just wasn't possible to budget them in when we had something already that "sort of" worked. So, 
	as I studied web development, I realized that I could solve this problem I had. I could create 
	an app that people could customize but didn't have to pay $3,500 a year for 12 employees to use.</p>
