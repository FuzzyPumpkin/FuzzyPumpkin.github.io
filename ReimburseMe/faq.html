	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h2>How much does this cost...really?</h2>
	<p>Nothing. You can choose to pay for a premium membership for $10 per login. Premium
	 membership removes ads. It doesn't affect what forms you have access to, how many user
	  profiles you can set up as an administrator, or how many you can submit to as a user. It doesn't unlock 
	  any features. It removes ads. Period. And it is charged only one time, not yearly or
	   monthly.</p>
	<h2>Do I have to register?</h2>
	<p>No...but if you want to set up or use a user profile, you'll need to be registered. 
	User profiles are where the customization my app allows come into play. If you just want
	 to use the default categories and settings on each form and manually fill in where the 
	 forms will submit, you can do so without registering.</p>
	<h2>HELP ME!</h2>
	<p>Help for each form is available on the form. Just click the <i class="far fa-question-circle"></i>.</p>
	<h2>Ugh. Ads.</h2>
	<p>Yeah, I know. I hate ads, too. Unfortunately, things cost money. Servers and my development time, 
	for example. Ads pay me so you don't have to. I try to make sure that the ads on this site are 
	relevant, not flashy or distracting, and aren't clickbait (Outbrain/Taboola ads are the worst!). 
	If the ads really bother you too much, you can pay $10 per login ONCE and never see one again. Here, 
	anyway.</p>
	<h2>Why did you make this app?</h2>
	<p>I have extensive experience as a peon in Accounting. Not a CPA, not a CFO, but an 
	assistant. That means that I have taken care of processing a lot of employee submissions 
	for reimbursement, as well as reimbursement requests from volunteers and contractors. I've 
	used printed forms only where everything is submitted by hand. I've used Sharepoint, and I've 
	investigated other services/apps/programs that have been created to streamline reimbursements. 
	None of them were perfect. All of the other apps out there were behind a paywall so high that it 
	just wasn't possible to budget them in when we had something already that "sort of" worked. So, 
	as I studied web development, I realized that I could solve this problem I had. I could create 
	an app that people could customize but didn't have to pay $3,500 a year for 12 employees to use.</p>
