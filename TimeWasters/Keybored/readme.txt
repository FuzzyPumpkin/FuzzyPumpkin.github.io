Keybored

This is a small fun app created to play with a JavaScript library and data keys that were added in ES6. It was especially challenging because the library, Paint.js, is incompatible with ES6 and actually has limited compatibility with standard ES5 (eventListeners, specifically). It fires copious errors when you try to put Paint.js code (paperscript) in a separate file if that file is not hosted online. Due to these issues, I had to keep the Paint.js code in the html file, which had me internally screaming "bad practice!" the entire time I worked on the project. Again due to the fact that Paint.js does not allow you to set traditional eventListeners and doesn't have any alternative way to assign a click event to a div, I wasn't able to make it work on mobile since you need an on-screen keyboard.

Languages/Frameworks/Databases used:

    HTML/CSS/Javascript, the trinity
    Paint.js

While this project did not turn out like my original plan due to the difficulties with working with a library that badly needs an update, it of course was still a valuable learning experience, if a disappointing one. This was my first time working with audio events and with the canvas.
