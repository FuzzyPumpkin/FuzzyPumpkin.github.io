This is a collection of small apps made mostly to practice coding on my own with little wins. Some of these are specifically to utilize learnings from a framework or library I found useful but which didn't really fit into one of my larger, full-site portfolio projects. Some are done to get away from using frameworks/libraries for a bit, or to drill methods into my brain. Each completed app has a readme that explains a bit about why it exists, what languages and tools were used, and my personal growth process while making it. Sometimes I write a bit of code in them that I later know better how to fix in a more standard way (see the TicTacToe game and the issue I had with function firing and resetting event listeners), but if I thought that solution was creative, I may have left it there.

The basic premise for this site, as a user, is a collection of little games and tools that one can use when one is looking for a little distraction. Think "Bored.com" before it was flooded with people ripping other games, or Kongregate without the chatting and forum functionality that I personally find distracting.
