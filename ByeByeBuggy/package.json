While reading a forum post, I followed a link to the website of a particular product. That product's website was extremely dated. It had dead links. The contact information was supposed to be links but was just plain text, and the menu coding was such that only one of four menu items ever showed. The console was rife more than 15 errors. It needed a redesign, badly.",
