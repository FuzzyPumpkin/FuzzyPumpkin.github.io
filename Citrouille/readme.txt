Citrioulle Floue
This is a site created for a fictious restaurant. I gave myself a challenge of creating a fully-functional static site that could be used on a professional level within a week while taking two masterclass Udemy courses. There are a few subtle CSS and JavaScript animations on the site, as well as custom JavaScript form validation. I'm especially proud of the form and open/closed status programming since it evaluates the input or the current time to see how it relates to the business hours.

"Citrioulle Floue" is a bit of a riff on my internet persona, Fuzzy Pumpkin. It's the translation of "Fuzzy Pumpkin" in French, and my 'net name was born of a forum post where I expressed that my poor grasp of French, despite taking it for four years, would result in me doing something stupid like calling someone a fuzzy pumpkin. The forum administrator then changed my title to "Fuzzy Pumpkin". The 'net name I'd been using up to then was problematic, so I took on the moniker.

Also, I really like pumpkin.

Site passes all Lighthouse audits with 93% or above. Background sizes set to cover always mess up that "Best Practices" score. Site is fully mobile-friendly and tested on such, though it displays well on standard desktop and wide-screen monitors.
