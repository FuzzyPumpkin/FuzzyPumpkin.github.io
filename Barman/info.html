              <h2><i class="fas fa-cocktail fa-m"></i> Is Barman available in my area?</h2>
              <p class="faq__p">Right now, Barman is available in the major metro areas of Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles.
                 We hope to expand our services in the future, once there is enough demand. If you are interested in joining but 
                 are not in our current service areas, please email us.
              </p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-cocktail fa-m"></i> Does anyone have to be home to receive the shipment?</h2>
                <p class="faq__p">Since our service includes alcohol, someone does need to be home to sign for the shipment.
                  That person needs to have a valid ID that shows that they are 21 years old or over. If you have chosen The 
                  Teetotaller option, no one needs to be there to sign. However, we recommend that the package be picked up
                  within 8 hours to guarantee the freshness of any produce.

                <h2><i class="fas fa-cocktail fa-m"></i> I'm allergic to mangoes. Can you make sure you don't give me mangoes?</h2>
                <p class="faq__p">Yes! Please be sure to list your allergies on the signup form. If you aren't allergic to a 
                  food but don't like that food, we encourage you to be open to that ingredient. It may be that you don't like cooked 
                  mangoes but you love them fresh.
