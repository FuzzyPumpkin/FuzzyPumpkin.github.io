# Barman

This is a site created for a fictious delivery service, similar to HelloFresh, but for cocktails. Annoyed with designers that follow the trend of 100vh hero images without giving any indication that there's page content below it, I decided to make a site where all the content was contained in one view height/width. This is a lot harder than it seems because one view height/width is different not only on desktop and mobile and widescreen, but even on individual devices. It's probably impossible for me to get all of them to the look I want, but I tried to cater to a variety of modern devices and some legacy ones. I myself use a MotoX4, which isn't the greatest phone but gets it done.

This was my first time using SVG clip paths for background images.
