<h1>Portfolio site of Kari Minger, aka FuzzyPumpkin</h1>
	<p>Here lies the future site where Kari will shill herself through the following methods:
		<ul>
			<li>a professional resume</li>
			<li>an extensive portfolio containing examples of skills</li>
			<li>cookies, perhaps of byte and biteable varieties</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Completely independent code practice projects</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="bouncy.html">Bouncy ball test</a> - a test of CSS animations and size manipulation</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Free Code Camp certification exercises</h2>
	<h3>Responsive Web Design Certification</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Tribute Page: <a href="FCCCert1TributeRaw.html">Initial for credit</a></li>
		<li>Survey Form: <a href="FCCCert1SurveyRaw.html">Initial for credit</a></li>
	</ul>
	Note: When I initially started working on the assignments for this certification, I treated each assignment as a standalone with 
	its own concept. I set up a basic page for each to fulfill requirements with the thought that I would come back later and improve
	 upon the design and usability (aka: prettify). When I began the third project and needed to include a nav bar, I realized it would
	 be much better to create all projects as part of one parent mock-site with an overarching theme. For this reason, the first two 
	assignments in their initial form are drastically different from their final state.
