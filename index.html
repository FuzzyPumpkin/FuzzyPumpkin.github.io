				<p>This is a small, very specialized review/blog site created with Node.js, 
				MongoDB, and various packages, using Bootstrap 4.0 as a CSS framework. The site features user 
				authentication and permissions relating to the edit/create/delete routes. Bootstrap 4.0 was used 
				to show familiarity with the framework and styles were kept mostly to those available with the 
				framework. I tried to keep manual CSS to a minimum since manual CSS is my preference, as a challenge.</p>
				<p>Future plans:
					<ul>
						<li>Design overhaul. Right now the site look is very basic.</li>
						<li>Adding subtle animations.</li>
						<li>Splash/landing page. It would add to the experience to have a small intro to Colby and 
							his world.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>As an added bonus, there is an easter egg you can find on the site. You must be logged in. Happy 
					clicking!</p>

				<p>This is a site created for a fictious delivery service, similar to HelloFresh, but for cocktails. 
					Annoyed with designers that follow the trend of 100vh hero images without giving any indication 
					that there's page content below it, I decided to make a site where all the content was contained 
					in one view height/width. This is a lot harder than it seems because one view height/width is 
					different not only on desktop and mobile and widescreen, but even on individual devices. It's 
					probably impossible for me to get all of them to the look I want, but I tried to cater to a variety 
					of modern devices and some legacy ones. I myself use a MotoX4, which isn't the greatest phone but 
					gets it done.

				<p>This is a site created for a fictious restaurant. There are a few subtle CSS and JavaScript animations on the site, as well as custom JavaScript 
				form validation. I'm especially proud of the form and open/closed status programming since it evaluates 
				the input or the current time to see how it relates to the business hours.</p>

				<p>"Citrouille Floue" is a bit of a riff on my internet persona, Fuzzy Pumpkin. It's the translation of 
					"Fuzzy Pumpkin" in French, and my 'net name was born of a forum post where I expressed that my poor 
					grasp of French, despite taking it for four years, would result in me doing something stupid like 
					calling someone a fuzzy pumpkin. The forum administrator then changed my title to "Fuzzy Pumpkin". 
					The 'net name I'd been using up to then was problematic, so I took on the moniker.</p>

				<p>Also, I really like pumpkin.</p>

				<p>This is a site created for a fictious realtor. I gave myself a challenge of creating a fully-functional 
					static site that could be used on a professional level within five days (approximately 8.5 working hours) 
					as my first focused complete-site project. I was able to achieve that goal. There are a few subtle CSS and 
					JavaScript animations on the site, as well as custom JavaScript form validation.
				</p>
				<p>Site passes all Lighthouse audits with 90% or above. The sticking point is on the index page's accessibility 
					test, as for some reason that particular page's test incorrectly marks the text on the parallax footer as 
					being on a white background. Without that error, it should be at 100% accessibility similar to the other 
					two pages. Site is fully mobile-friendly and tested on such, though it displays well on standard desktop and 
					wide-screen monitors.
