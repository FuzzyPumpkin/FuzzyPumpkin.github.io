Api Happi

One of the two capstone projects I assigned myself before taking the leap to try to find a job in web dev.

This is a dashboard app, created in React, in the style of ye olde My Yahoo. In a way, My Yahoo was like a mini smart phone before we had smart phones. There were customizable widgets that you could set up to get your daily weather, horoscope, news, and other items whenever you opened your browser.

Api Happi is set up to be a consistent tool you can use across devices. Use it on your phone, your tablet, your desktop, with all the same settings and your notes and lists kept in the state you last left them. It has a lot of the little tools I find myself using throughout the day. Could I just download a bunch of aps and use them on my phone? Sure. But by putting these all in one little package, I don't need to search around.

Api Happi pulls data from several different apis. It utilizes a few JavaScript-heavy tools I've coded for the mundane.
