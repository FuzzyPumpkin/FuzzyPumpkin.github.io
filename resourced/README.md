# reSOURCEd

This is a site created to track resources I have found helpful in my journey to learn how to be a web developer. It includes courses I have taken as well as tools and lexicons I regularly refer to. While my main reason for creating the project was to gain more practice in using React, specifically routing in React, it also was to address the fact that I use three computers to learn and code on, as well as multiple browsers on those computers, and my repository of useful links were scattered throughout those browsers. This site keeps all of my links together and accessible from anywhere. Could I have just used a browser extension that someone else has created? Of course! This, however, was more difficult.

Content is managed through a JSON. I contemplated setting up a backend and using MongoDB instead, but considering the simplicity of the overall project structure, it did not seem to make sense and would have increased the possibility of having an issue if the backend server or MongoAtlas were to experience downtime. The navigation bar and routes automatically update when new tags are used in the JSON, managed through state.
