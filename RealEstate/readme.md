# Stacey Evy, Realtor

This is a site created for a fictious realtor. I gave myself a challenge of creating a fully-functional static site that could be used on a professional level within five days (approximately 8.5 working hours) as my first focused complete-site project. I was able to achieve that goal. There are a few subtle CSS and JavaScript animations on the site, as well as custom JavaScript form validation.

## Technologies Utilized
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Installation

To use the app/site, simply visit https://fuzzypumpkin.github.io/Barman/. If you would like to download the code and run it on your development environment, you can either fork the repo or click on "Clone or Download" and download as a .zip file. Open the extracted folder in the code editor of your choice.
