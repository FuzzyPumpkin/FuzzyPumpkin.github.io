Stacey Evy: Realtor
This is a site created for a fictious realtor. I gave myself a challenge of creating a fully-functional static site that could be used on a professional level within five days (approximately 8.5 working hours) as my first focused complete-site project. I was able to achieve that goal. There are a few subtle CSS and JavaScript animations on the site, as well as custom JavaScript form validation.

Site passes all Lighthouse audits with 90% or above. The sticking point is on the index page's accessibility test, as for some reason that particular page's test incorrectly marks the text on the parallax footer as being on a white background. Without that error, it should be at 100% accessibility similar to the other two pages. Site is fully mobile-friendly and tested on such, though it displays well on standard desktop and wide-screen monitors.
