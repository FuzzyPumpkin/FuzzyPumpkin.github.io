Note: Youtube tutorial was unworkable as presenter's screen was unreadable and too much did not relate to the app 
I wanted to create. In addition, his methods to use Firebase were unnecessarily complex to the point where the code 
was incredibly unclear. Deleted most of tutorial and recreated Firebase access from docs. Timeframe was extended due 
to illness and kitten invasion.
