# Organizm

--project in progress--
This is a massive undertaking, a life-organization app that handles tasks, calendar, menu-planning, travel-planning, and completely customizable goal and symptom tracking. It will include some reporting functions. 

I am starting this by following an excellent tutorial shared by FreeCodeCamp "Intermediate React Tutorial - Todoist Clone (with Firebase, Custom Hooks, SCSS, React Testing)" found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT3j87FMR6M. Creating an app like this is within my current abilities, but I wanted to see another perspective on React app creation than I've seen with Colt Steele and Brad Traversy. I'm making some of my own changes along the way, keeping with functional components but not arrow functions as I like the explicit return. The app in the tutorial only has a fraction of the functionality I have planned.

Project was wireframed and then layout created in Figma. Most graphics are svg icons from IcoMoon, but a few are my own creation.
